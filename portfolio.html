                Gini coefficient indicator depicts income inequality. Chart A shows that the trend has larely remained stable since 2008. But there has been a slight increase in the Gini coeefficient for all individuals(1.9 points) and retired individuals(3.9 points) in a ten year period from 2011/12 to 2021/22.
                Chart B shows that UK's Gini coefficient is one of the highest among the OECD countries and requires policy intervention.

                Under-five mortality (U5MR) is defined as the number of deaths per 1000 live births for children less than 5 years old. Chart A shows the base map of India with the states. Using data from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2019-20), Chart B shows the wide variations in under-five mortality rates across different states with southern states like Kerala having lower mortality rates while northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar having above national average mortality requiring greater focus and policy intervention.
