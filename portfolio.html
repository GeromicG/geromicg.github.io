                Gini coefficient indicator depicts income inequality. Chart A shows that the trend has larely remained stable since 2008. But there has been a slight increase in the Gini coeefficient for all individuals(1.9 points) and retired individuals(3.9 points) in a ten year period from 2011/12 to 2021/22.
                Chart B shows that UK's Gini coefficient is one of the highest among the OECD countries and requires policy intervention.

Using data from the National Family Health Survey 4 (2019-20), Chart B shows the wide variations in under-five mortality rates across different states with southern states like Kerala having lower mortality rates while northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar having above national average mortality requiring greater focus and policy intervention.

                <h3>Journey of India's Rupee & No 'Runaway' Public Debt except for Japan</h3>
                <p> The 1st interactive chart is related to India's currency exchange rate system. In 1985, rupee was further devalued to 12 against a dollar. In 1991, India faced a balance of payment crisis and was forced to sharply devalue its currency currency leading to floating exchange regime determined by market sentiments and intervention by the central bank only in cases of extreme volatility. The Indian rupee has gradually depreciated since the global recession in 2008 with another sharp depreciation in 2020 -21 during Covid-19.
                 </p>
                <p> In 2nd interactive chart, public debts of six countries are depicted. In the last thirty years, except for Japan, other countries have seen their debt to GDP ratios increase in a 'manageable' way.The python code used for scraping is here - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mi_2qEV6J0UVyWkIUqXkLo1Rog_Mc102?usp=sharing">Google Colab Scraping Notebook</a></p>
