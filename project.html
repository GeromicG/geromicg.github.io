           This page acts as my project page for the PP434: Automated Data Visualisation for Policymaking course, part of the MPP programme at LSE. 
        The project is divided into 6 parts that analyse the impact of tropical enteropathy on child malnutrition & mortality in India and the policy response to it.

                <h2>Part I: Introduction</h2>
                <p><b>Objectives:</b> This project examines the relationship and impact of malnutrition, women's education and improved access to sanitation (government intervention) on child mortality outcomes in children (under five) across Indian states. 
                 It also aims to propose effective strategies to policy makers for reducing child mortality and realise UN's Sustainable Development Targets on child mortality and nutrition.</p>
                <p><b>Dependent Variables:</b> Malutrition - Percentage of children under 5 years who are stunted (height-for-age), underweight (weight-for-age) and wasted (weight-for-height); Women (age 15-49)  with 10 or more years of schooling; Population living in households that use an improved sanitation facility (%); and Children age 12-23 months who have received 3 doses of rotavirus vaccine.</p>
                <p><b>Independent Variables:</b>Under-five mortality rate (per 1000 live births)
            <p><b>Data:</b> National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 1 [1992-93], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 2 [1998-99], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 3 [2005-06], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 4 [2015-16], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 5 [2019-21]and Census of India (2011).

                <h2>Part II: Relationship between Child Malnutrition & Access to Sanitation in India</h2>
                <p><b>Defining Child Malnutrition Variables:</b>
                 
<p><b>Stunted:</b>A child is said to be stunted when the “child’s height-for-age Z score is less than -2 standard deviations (SD) from the median reference population”.  
<br><b>Underweight:</b>A child is said to be underweight i.e. suffering from “acute and chronic malnutrition if their weight-for-age is below minus 2 standard deviations from the median reference population. 
<br><b>Wasted:</b>A child whose weight-for-height Z score is less than -2 SD from the median reference population are thin (wasted) for their height and are acutely malnourished.
</p>
    <p><b>Analytical Framework:</b> In order to analyse the relationship between child malnutrition variables and access to improved sanitation, we refer to NFHS - 5 (2019-21) data state wise to create bubble correlation charts (population adjusted) and conduct coorelation analysis between the two.  </p>

 <div class="chart-description">
            <p><b>Interpretation:</b>Correlation analysis shows that there is moderately negative relationship between child malutrition outcomes and access to improved sanitation in different states. Nearly all populous states perform poorly with Kerala being an outlier with exceptional access to sanitation. Tropical enteropathy, a subclinical condition characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, is closely linked to poor sanitation and malnutrition in India. 
                Unsanitary living conditions expose individuals to fecal pathogens, leading to repeated intestinal infections. This disrupts nutrient absorption, impairing growth and immune function. Children are particularly vulnerable, as tropical enteropathy perpetuates a cycle of malnutrition, stunted growth, and weakened immunity. 
                Addressing inadequate sanitation and promoting hygiene practices are critical to breaking this cycle and improving public health outcomes in India.</p>

                <h2>Part III: Regional Variations in Child Health Outcomes in India</h2>
                <p>Under-five mortality (U5MR) is defined as the number of deaths per 1000 live births for children less than 5 years old. 
                Using data from the National Family Health Survey 5 (2019-20), this chart shows the wide variations in under-five mortality rates across different states with southern states like Kerala having lower mortality rates while northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar having above national average mortality.</p>

            <h2>Part IV: Policy Response - Swachh Bharat Mission for increasing sanitation access across India.</h2>
                <p> History shows that installation of modern sewage systems in large cities like London and New York transformed the health of nations, by eliminating the spread on many diseases that thrive on poor sanitation and sewage. Attention of public health policy should shift to improving the sewage collection, treatment systems in urban, semi-urban and semi-rural areas of each state. Given that our goal is to become a upper middle income country in 5-7 years, and a high income country in 25 years, we need to develop State level grids for collecting, processing and recycling sewage and solid waste in the next ten years.</p>

            <h2>Part VI: Conclusion - Policy Focus</h2>
                <p> The most noteworthy feature of the project is the significant effect of Child malnutrition on Child mortality. The implication of this result is that both Stunted and Under-weight children are more vulnerable to mortality triggered by other causes such as life-threatening diseases. In other words, the probability of death due to these diseases is higher for stunted and underweight children than for normal children (under 5). Improved sanitation- private and shared, therefore reduces child malnutrition, which in turn reduces child mortality across Indian States. Access to and use of public health information, proxied in the study by female education levels, is also found to have a significant effect on child mortality. Mother’s education is critical for understanding and using information about child health & well-being. Therefore find a strong and significant effect of female education on child mortality. Simulations show that another 5.9 per cent points improvement in the per cent of females with more than 10 years of education, would reduce child mortality 6.3% points. This reinforces many earlier studies on the important role of female education, on the economy and society.Improved sanitation- private and shared, therefore reduces child malnutrition, which in turn reduces child mortality across Indian States.</p>
