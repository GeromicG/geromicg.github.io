                <h2>Part I: Introduction</h2>
                <p><b>Objectives:</b> This project aims to examine the relationship between child mortality outcomes in children (under five) across Indian states and various factors that may infleunce it such as malnutrition, women's education and improved access to sanitation (government intervention). 
                 It also aims to propose effective strategies to policy makers for reducing child mortality and realise UN's Sustainable Development Goals on child mortality and nutrition.</p>
                <p><b>Dependent Variables:</b> Malutrition - Percentage of children under 5 years who are stunted (height-for-age), underweight (weight-for-age) and wasted (weight-for-height); Women (age 15-49)  with 10 or more years of schooling; Population living in households that use an improved sanitation facility (%); and Children age 12-23 months who have received 3 doses of rotavirus vaccine.</p>
                <p><b>Independent Variables:</b>Under-five mortality rate (per 1000 live births)
            <p><b>Data:</b> National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 1 [1992-93], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 2 [1998-99], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 3 [2005-06], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 4 [2015-16], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 5 [2019-21]and Census of India (2011).

                <h2>Part II: Relationship between Child Malnutrition & Access to Sanitation in India</h2>
                <p><b>Defining Child Malnutrition Variables:</b>
                 
<p><b>Stunted:</b>A child is said to be stunted when the “child’s height-for-age Z score is less than -2 standard deviations (SD) from the median reference population”.  
<br><b>Underweight:</b>A child is said to be underweight i.e. suffering from “acute and chronic malnutrition if their weight-for-age is below minus 2 standard deviations from the median reference population. 
<br><b>Wasted:</b>A child whose weight-for-height Z score is less than -2 SD from the median reference population are thin (wasted) for their height and are acutely malnourished.
</p>
    <p><b>Analytical Framework:</b> In order to analyse the relationship between child malnutrition variables and access to improved sanitation, we refer to NFHS - 5 (2019-21) data state wise to create bubble correlation charts (population adjusted) and conduct coorelation analysis between the two. 
    The python code used to extract and the filter the NFHS 5 dataset and estimate correlation is here - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SE6Icraj3Idix65jb5pegqKlF9DVhgqE?usp=sharing">Google CoLab Project Data Analysis Notebook</a></p>

 <div class="chart-description">
            <p><b>Interpretation:</b>Correlation analysis shows that there is moderately negative relationship between child malutrition outcomes and access to improved sanitation in different states. Nearly all populous states perform poorly with Kerala being an outlier with exceptional access to sanitation. Tropical enteropathy, a subclinical condition characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, is closely linked to poor sanitation and malnutrition in India. 
                Unsanitary living conditions expose individuals to fecal pathogens, leading to repeated intestinal infections. This disrupts nutrient absorption, impairing growth and immune function. Children are particularly vulnerable, as tropical enteropathy perpetuates a cycle of malnutrition, stunted growth, and weakened immunity. 
                Addressing inadequate sanitation and promoting hygiene practices are critical to breaking this cycle and improving public health outcomes in India.</p>

                <h2> Linking Child Mortality with sanitation and maternal.</h2>
                <h3> Regressing Child Mortality on maternal and child health & education indicators.</h3>
                <p> Based on NFHS data and negative correlation of child malnutrition with sanitation seen in Part II, the following simple linear regression model is contructed for analysis
                <center>U5MR_i = β_0 + β_1(Women with 10+ years of schooling_i) + β_2(Improved sanitation facility_i)+ β3(Below normal BMI Women_i) + β_4(Stunted_i) + β_5(Wasted_i) + β_6(Underweight_i) +  β_7(Children with diarrhoea taken to a health facility i) + ϵ_i</center><br><br>
    <b>Dependent Variable:</b>	U5MR_i: Under-five mortality rate for state_i which is defined as the number of deaths per 1000 live births for children less than 5 years old.<br>
<b>Independent Variables (Predictors):</b><br>
o	Women with 10+ years of schooling_i: Percentage of women (aged 15-49) with 10 or more years of schooling in state_i.<br>
o	Improved sanitation facility_i: Percentage of the population in state_i living in households using improved sanitation facilities.<br>
o	Below normal BMI Women_i: Women (age 15-49 years) whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is below normal (BMI <18.5 kg/m2)%<br>
o	Stunted_i: Percentage of children under five years in state iii who are stunted (height-for-age).<br>
o	Wasted_i : Percentage of children under five years in state iii who are wasted (weight-for-height).<br>
o	Underweight_i : Percentage of children under five years in state iii who are underweight (weight-for-age).<br>
o	Children with diarrhoea taken to a health facility_i: Children with diarrhoea in the 2 weeks preceding the survey taken to a health facility or health provider (Children under age 5 years) (%). This is a proxy for access to health facilities and signifies that diarrhoea is the third biggest cause for child mortality in India. <br>
o	ϵi: Error term representing unobserved random factors.<br><br>
<b>Coefficients:</b>β_0, β_1, β_2, β_3, β_4, β_5, β_6 are parameters to be estimated, representing the relationship between each independent variable and the under-five mortality rate.<br><br>

<b>Assumptions:</b>The relationship between the predictors and U5MR is linear. Errors are independently and identically distributed with mean 0 and constant variance. Fixed effects  accounting for state-specific, time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity are not of relevance.<br>

<p><b>Analytical Framework:</b> In order to analyse, the python code used to do simple OLS regression of the filtered NFHS 5 dataset and estimating the coefficients is here - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JsxaxJvW9_-m5USM0_YIZ_0engWJrA8y?usp=sharing">Google CoLab Project Data Analysis Notebook</a>
Based on this regression, a trellis chart is created which depicts the regression of Under-five mortality rate for state_i on independent variables that represent indicators of sanitation, child health, women's education and health. </p>

<div class="chart-description">
<p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
<b>R-squared (0.731):</b> This value indicates that 73.1% of the variability in the under-five mortality rate is explained by the independent variables in the model. This suggests a good fit.<br>
<b>Significant variables:</b> Regression analysis shows that four independent variables are significant at 10% level of significance (considering the small sample size and simple model) which are:<br>
<b>- Women (age 15-49) with 10 or more years of schooling (%): β_1 = - 0.3311 </b>Female education significantly reduces under-five mortality rates.<br>
<b>- Population living in households that use an improved sanitation facility (%):β_2 = - 0.2611 </b> Access to improved sanitation is associated with lower under-five mortality rates.<br>
<b>- Women (age 15-49 years) whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is below normal (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) (%): β_3 = 1.3275 </b> Poor maternal nutrition is associated with higher under-five mortality rates.<br>
<b>- Children under 5 years who are stunted (height-for-age)18 (%): β_4 = 1.0098 </b> Higher stunting rates are associated with higher under-five mortality rates.<br>

          <p><b>Interpretation:Idea of 'Aspirational States'</b><br>
        Using data from the National Family Health Survey 5 (2019-21), the two charts show the wide variations in under-five mortality rates across different states with southern states like Kerala having lower mortality rates while northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar having above national average mortality.
          Specifically, it can be seen that a <b>class of 'aspirational states' exist - Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu</b> which are progressing rapidly but are also 'low-hanging fruits' from a policy perspective.
          <br>Meghalaya is an <b>outlier</b> in stunting which is unusual as it does relatively better in other indicators and this needs to be examined more thoroughly in future.</p>

                <p> History shows that installation of modern sewage systems in large cities like London and New York transformed the health of nations, by eliminating the spread on many diseases that thrive on poor sanitation and sewage. Attention of public health policy should shift to improving the sewage collection, treatment systems in urban, semi-urban and semi-rural areas of each state. Given that our goal is to become a upper middle income country in 5-7 years, and a high income country in 25 years, we need to develop State level grids for collecting, processing and recycling sewage and solid waste in the next ten years.</p>

            <h2>Part VI: Conclusion </h2>
     <h3>Summary of Findings & Policy Recommendations</h3>    
    <p> The key findings can be summarized as follows:<br>
     1. Female education plays a pivotal role in reducing under-five mortality rates, as evidenced by the inverse relationship between the percentage of women with 10 or more years of schooling and child mortality.
       Simiarly, high maternal undernutrition, indicated by a BMI below normal is strongly associated with increased under-five mortality rates.
    This finding underscores the transformative impact of empowering women through education and better health support, as it enhances health literacy, economic opportunities, and decision-making capabilities that benefit child survival.<br> 
     2. Improved sanitation through government intervnetions emerges as a critical determinant, directly reducing exposure to diseases (by curbing tropical enteropathy) that disproportionately affect children in their formative years.<br>
     3. Stunted children are apparently more vulnerable to mortality triggered by other causes such as life-threatening diseases as it was a statistically signifcant predictor in the regression model. 
     4. Regional disparities in access to sanitation coverage and nutrition outcomes exist in India in the form of a class of 'aspirational states' which aspire to reach upto national average.<br>  <br></p>

    <h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
<p>The analysis of the relationships between under-five mortality rates and key socioeconomic and health indicators highlights significant pathways for addressing child mortality in India. 
To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on child health and sanitation, India should prioritize multi-sectoral strategies. <br> 
<b>First,</b> scaling up public investments in women’s education, particularly in 'aspirational states' like UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh etc. can yield an inter-generational long-term health dividend for children.<br> 
<b>Second,</b> accelerating the implementation of sanitation programs, such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, with a focus on improving quality of toilets (individual private houhehold toilets and adequate liquid and solid waste management at community level) and behavioral change in regions lagging behind, will have direct and immediate benefits.<br> 
<b>Thirdly,</b> strengthening maternal health programs to address undernutrition among women and implementing community-based nutrition interventions targeting stunting among children can significantly improve child survival outcomes.<br>
Through such integrated efforts, India can make substantial progress toward achieving SDG targets on reducing child malnutrition, mortality, and improving access to sanitation by 2030.
Improved sanitation- private and shared, therefore reduces child malnutrition, which in turn reduces child mortality across Indian States. Access to and use of public health information, proxied in the study by female education levels, is also found to have a significant effect on child mortality. Mother’s education is critical for understanding and using information about child health & well-being. Therefore find a strong and significant effect of female education on child mortality.
