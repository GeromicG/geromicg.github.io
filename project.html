                <h2>Part I: Introduction</h2>
                <p><b>Objectives:</b> This project aims to examine the relationship between child mortality outcomes in children (under five) across Indian states and various factors that may infleunce it such as malnutrition, women's education and improved access to sanitation (government intervention). 
              <p><b>Data:</b> National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 1 [1992-93], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 2 [1998-99], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 3 [2005-06], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 4 [2015-16], National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 5 [2019-21]and Census of India (2011).

                <h2>Part II: Relationship between Child Malnutrition & Access to Sanitation in India</h2>
                <p><b>Defining Child Malnutrition Variables:</b>
                 
<p><b>Stunted:</b>A child is said to be stunted when the “child’s height-for-age Z score is less than -2 standard deviations (SD) from the median reference population”.  
<br><b>Underweight:</b>A child is said to be underweight i.e. suffering from “acute and chronic malnutrition if their weight-for-age is below minus 2 standard deviations from the median. 
<br><b>Wasted:</b>A child whose weight-for-height Z score is less than -2 SD from the median reference are thin (wasted) for their height and are acutely malnourished.
</p>
    <p><b>Analytical Framework:</b> In order to analyse the relationship between child malnutrition variables and access to improved sanitation, we refer to NFHS - 5 (2019-21) data state wise to create bubble correlation charts (population adjusted) and conduct coorelation analysis between the two. 
    The python code used to extract and the filter the NFHS 5 dataset and estimate correlation is here - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SE6Icraj3Idix65jb5pegqKlF9DVhgqE?usp=sharing">Google CoLab Project Data Analysis Notebook</a></p>

 <div class="chart-description">
            <p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>Correlation analysis shows that there is moderately negative relationship between child malutrition outcomes and access to improved sanitation in different states. The likely explanation is tropical enteropathy, a subclinical condition tied to poor sanitation and malnutrition in India, causes chronic intestinal inflammation. 
                Unsanitary conditions lead to repeated infections, disrupting nutrient absorption and impairing growth and immunity. Children are especially at risk, trapped in a cycle of malnutrition, stunted growth, and weakened immunity.

                <h2> Linking Child Mortality with Health and Education Indicators.</h2>
                <h3> Regressing Child Mortality on sanitation, maternal and child health & education indicators.</h3>
                <p> Based on NFHS data and negative correlation of child malnutrition with sanitation seen in Part II, the following simple linear regression model is contructed for analysis
                <center>U5MR_i = β_0 + β_1(Women with 10+ years of schooling_i) + β_2(Improved sanitation facility_i)+ β_3(Below normal BMI Women_i) + β_4(Stunted_i) + β_5(Wasted_i) + β_6(Underweight_i) +  β_7(Children with diarrhoea taken to a health facility_i) + ϵ_i</center><br><br>
   <b>Dependent Variable:</b> U5MR_i: Under-five mortality rate for state_i, defined as deaths per 1000 live births for children under 5.<br>
<b>Independent Variables (Predictors):</b><br>
o	Women with 10+ years of schooling_i: Percentage of women (15-49) with 10+ years of schooling in state_i.<br>
o	Improved sanitation facility_i: Percentage of households in state_i using improved sanitation.<br>
o	Below normal BMI Women_i: Percentage of women (15-49) in state_i with BMI <18.5 kg/m2.<br>
o	Stunted_i: Percentage of children under five in state_i who are stunted (height-for-age).<br>
o	Wasted_i: Percentage of children under five in state_i who are wasted (weight-for-height).<br>
o	Underweight_i: Percentage of children under five in state_i who are underweight (weight-for-age).<br>
o	Children with diarrhoea taken to a health facility_i: Percentage of children under five with diarrhoea taken to a health provider in the 2 weeks before the survey, a proxy for health access and diarrhoea is leading cause of mortality.
    <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/643462/leading-causes-of-death-among-children-india/">Statista- Causes of Death of Children India</a><br>
o	ϵi: Error term representing unobserved random factors.<br><br>
<b>Coefficients:</b>β_0, β_1, β_2, β_3, β_4, β_5, β_6 are parameters to be estimated, representing the relationship between each independent variable and the under-five mortality rate.<br><br>

<b>Assumptions:</b>The relationship between the predictors and U5MR is linear. Errors are independently and identically distributed with mean 0 and constant variance. Fixed effects  accounting for state-specific, time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity are not of relevance.<br><br>

<p><b>Analytical Framework:</b> In order to analyse, the python code used to do simple OLS regression of the filtered NFHS 5 dataset and estimating the coefficients is here - <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JsxaxJvW9_-m5USM0_YIZ_0engWJrA8y?usp=sharing">Google CoLab Project Data Analysis Notebook</a>
Based on this regression, a trellis chart is created which depicts the regression of U5MR for state_i on independent variables that represent indicators of sanitation, child health, women's education and health. </p>

<div class="chart-description">
<p><b>Interpretation:</b><br>
<b>R-squared (0.731):</b> 73.1% of the variability in under-five mortality is explained by the model, indicating a good fit.<br>
<b>Significant Estimates:</b> Four variables are significant at the 10% level (small sample size), on average:<br>
<b>- Women (15-49) with 10+ years of schooling (%): β_1 = -0.3311</b> Higher female education associated with reduced under-five mortality.<br>
<b>- Improved sanitation (%): β_2 = -0.2611</b> Greater access to sanitation associated with lower under-five mortality.<br>
<b>- Women with BMI <18.5 (%): β_3 = 1.3275</b> Poor maternal nutrition associated with increased under-five mortality.<br>
<b>- Stunted children (%): β_4 = 1.0098</b> Higher stunting rates associated with increased under-five mortality.<br>
<p><b>Limitations:</b> Omitted variable bias, model specification and time & state fixed effects are limitations.</p>

          <p><b>Interpretation: Idea of 'Aspirational States'</b><br>
Using NFHS 5 (2019-21) data, the charts highlight wide regional variations in under-five mortality rates. A <b>class of 'aspirational states'</b>—Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, and union territories like Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu—are rapidly progressing yet remain behind key policy targets.<br>
The state of Meghalaya is an <b>outlier</b> in stunting while performing better in other indicators, warranting further investigation.</p>

            <h2>Part V: Assessing India's Progress </h2>
            <h3>India's Progress & Policy Response on Sanitation </h3>
    <p>Government of India's targetted intervention in sanitation began in 1999 with the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC).  It was succeeded by The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), launched on October 2, 2014, aimed to make India Open Defecation Free (ODF) by constructing individual and community toilets. SBM's targets included eliminating open defecation and improving solid and liquid waste management.

            <figcaption>Chart 8: Histogram showing India's massive construction of househould toilets through Swacch Bharat Mission Phase I. Almost 50% of it is in 'Aspirational States'.</figcaption><br>

                <p><b>Interpretation: </b><br>
        By analysing the NFHS data trends since 1992-93 to 2019-21, there has been consistent decline in the indicators of malnutrition and under five mortality rate in 2000s and 2010s which corresponds with the implementation of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) and it's predecessor.

            <h2>Part VI: Conclusion </h2>
    <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
<p>
1. Women’s education and health reduce under-five mortality.<br>
2. Improved sanitation reduces disease exposure, addressing tropical enteropathy and improves child survival.<br>
3. Stunted children are at higher risk of disease-related mortality.<br>
4. Regional disparities exist in sanitation and nutrition, with 'aspirational states' catching up.<br><br></p>

<h3>Policy Recommendations</h3>
<p>To meet SDGs on child health and sanitation by 20230, India should:<br>
<b>First,</b> boost women’s education, especially in aspirational states.<br>
<b>Second,</b> enhance sanitation quality, waste management, and behavioral change.<br>
<b>Thirdly,</b> strengthen maternal health and implement community nutrition programs to reduce stunting.<br> </p>
