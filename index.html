                Gini coefficient indicator depicts income inequality. Chart A shows that the trend has larely remained stable since 2008. But there has been a slight increase in the Gini coeefficient for all individuals(1.9 points) and retired individuals(3.9 points) in a ten year period from 2011/12 to 2021/22.
                Chart B shows that UK's Gini coefficient is one of the highest among the OECD countries and requires policy intervention.
