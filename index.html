                Gini coefficient indicator depicts income inequality in the UK. As per Chart A, the trend has largely remained stable since the 1990s, though there has been a slight increase in the Gini coeefficient for all individuals(1.9 points) and retired individuals(3.9 points) in a ten year period from 2011/12 to 2021/22.
                But as per Chart B, in relative terms we can observe that UK's Gini coefficient is one of the highest among the OECD countries and does require policy intervention.
